 Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 The Gaming Room was mainly focused on the mobile game players. This means that Iphone and Android users were their main focus. Creating a safe and secure gaming experience for both Apple and Android users is a top design feature they wanted the game to represent
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did well in the safety aspect of the document as I brainstormed ways to make the game safe for users. By implementing several safety protocols like  chat monitoring and a two-factor authentication when users purchase in game merchandise can save users from scammers.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When I learned more about the cloud and how it can be used to save players data like checkpoints and health. That opened my eyes to what else I could add to the code and input more better features and code into the game.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to choose one part of my work and revise it I would most definitley pick the username creation part. Instead of the user being able to create a username and the system automatically approving it. I would instead add a safety feature to if a certain name is sent to the system the system will check it for similarities of another user's name or a celebrity so that only the person who had that name  can keep their name with no copycats.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I would have a feedback option on the  website and allow users the ability to implement feedback on what needs fixed and what needs added. We are not going to play the game as much as the users do. The users play from the frontend of the system and we control the backend. Customer satisfaction is always the top priority.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached this project looking at my perspective. I quickly learned that my vision is mostly not what the user wants. In the future I will listen to feedback and approach the situation at hand properly.
